= Gradle XebiaLabs Dependency Management Plugin
:plugin_version: 0.1.0
:source-highlighter: pygments

This is the Gradle XebiaLabs Dependency Management plugin. When applied to your Gradle project it will be possible to omit version numbers from the specified dependencies, and have them come from imported dependency specification files.

== How to apply
This plugin is not published (_yet_) to Gradle Plugin Central. It is only available from our Nexus. Please apply the plugin using the following code in the `rootProject` _build.gradle_ file.

[source,groovy,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
.rootProject build.gradle
----
buildscript {
  repositories {
    maven {
        url "${nexusBaseUrl}/repositories/releases"
        credentials {
            username nexusUserName
            password nexusPassword
        }
    }

  }

  dependencies {
    classpath "com.xebialabs.gradle.plugins:gradle-xl-dependency-plugin:{plugin_version}"
  }

  apply plugin: 'xebialabs.dependency'
}

== Plugins contained

=== The 'xebialabs.dependency.base' plugin
This plugin is the _base_ plugin that doesn't force any opinions on the project. Note this plugin can _only_ be applied on the `rootProject`

==== What it does
When applied the plugin does the following:

- An extension named `dependencyManagement` is added to the `rootProject`
- The `resolutionStrategy` of `allProjects.configurations` is set to resolve versions against this plugin

=== The 'xebialabs.dependency' plugin
This plugin builds on top of the `xebialabs.dependency.base` plugin, and adds the opinion that every project should contain a `${rootProject.projectDir}/gradle/dependencies.conf` file, containing versions.

== How it works
Using the `dependencyManagement` extension it is possible to import configuration files containing dependency information.

- You can either import a file local to the project
- You can import a maven dependency using the shortform (`<group_id>:<artifact_id>:<version>`) dependency notation. In this case the plugin will attempt to find the `<artifact_id>.conf` file located at that location in the maven repository.

For example:

[source,groovy,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
.build.gradle example
----
apply plugin: 'java'
apply plugin: 'xebialabs.dependency'

dependencyManagement {
  importConf rootProject.file("path/to/hocon.conf")
  importConf "com.xebialabs.xlplatform:reference:1.0"
}

repositories {
  mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
  compile "com.typesafe.akka:akka-actor_$scalaVersion"
  testCompile "junit:junit"

}
----

== The file format
The plugin reads the dependency management specification from a https://github.com/typesafehub/config[HOCON] file. The format of the HOCON file should be the following:

[source,subs='verbatim,attributes']
.reference.conf
----
dependencyManagement {
  versions {
    junitVersion: "4.12"
    scalaVersion: "2.11"
    akkaVersion: "2.3.9"
  }
  dependencies: [
    "junit:junit:$junitVersion"
    {
      group: "com.typesafe.akka"
      version: "$akkaVersion"
      artifacts: [
        "akka-actor_$scalaVersion"
        "akka-testkit_$scalaVersion"
      ]
    }
  ]
  rewrites {
    "jdom:jdom": "org.jdom:jdom"
  }
  blacklist: [
    "com.google.collections:google-collections"
  ]
}
----

As is shown, there are 4 sections in the conf file.

=== The 'versions' section
The `versions` section allows you to define version numbers for dependencies in a single location. In this way you can (potentially) reuse a single version number for different artifacts. It is a map of key-value pairs

=== The 'dependencies' section
The `dependencies` section is a list of dependencies in either:

- `<group_id>:<artifact_id>:<version>` notation
- a block containing a group of similar artifacts sharing a `group_id` and `version`

The placeholders in the strings will be replaced with the data coming from the `versions` section.
Each matching dependency in each configuration of each project will be forced to use the version defined in this block.

=== The 'rewrites' section
The `rewrites` section contains group:artifact pairs that should be rewritten to a different group:artifact combination. This allows to map moved modules onto their new location.

=== The 'blacklist' section
The `blacklist` section contains `group` or `group:artifact` entries. All entries listed here will be blacklisted from all configurations of all projects.
